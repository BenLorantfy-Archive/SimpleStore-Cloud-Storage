# Report

This report details the ux choices and the reasons behind them based on the following usability heuristics. These heuristics were developed by Jakon Nielsen, a web usability consultant with a Ph.D. in humanâ€“computer interaction from the Technical University of Denmark in Copenhagen.

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

The following report will detail how each heuristic is satisfied with this design.


# Appendix A
The following is some feedback obtained from some UI design professionals about the initial designs.

Below are some points from a user interface designer at Nokia.
- Why is the username/password text so massive?
- The text boxes should be wider with smaller text and maybe not as tall
- What's the arrow beside math? It's not too clear.

Below are some points from a freelance web designer.
- Add back arrow of some kind
- Add drag & drop
