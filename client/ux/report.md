# Report

This report details the ux choices and the reasons behind them based on the following usability heuristics. These heuristics were developed by Jakon Nielsen, a web usability consultant with a Ph.D. in humanâ€“computer interaction from the Technical University of Denmark in Copenhagen.

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

The following report will detail how each heuristic is satisfied with this design.
